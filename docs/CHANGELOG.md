# Changelog

All notable changes to the Spreedly iOS SDK will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.7] - 2026-05-05

### Notes

Maintenance release with no functional changes from 1.3.6. Only the embedded `SpreedlySDK.version` string differs. Merchants on 1.3.6 do not need to upgrade.

## [1.3.6] - 2026-05-04

### Security

- **Signed release tags**: Stable releases are now GPG-signed with Spreedly's iOS release key and display the green Verified badge on GitHub. Contact Spreedly Support to obtain the public verification key for `git tag -v`.

### Fixed

- **Release page artifacts**: SBOM, framework `.zip` files, and `.zip.sha256` checksums are attached to every GitHub Release.
- **Install snippets match the published version**: The README install snippets and verification guide are refreshed on each release.

## [1.3.5] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Jailbreak device blocking**: New `blockJailbrokenDevices` option on `SpreedlyConfig` (defaults to `false`). When enabled, the SDK refuses to initialize on compromised devices and sets `Spreedly.initializationError` with a `SpreedlySecurityError`. Works from both Swift and Objective-C.
- **`Spreedly.blockJailbrokenDevices` static property**: For merchants using `initializeSDK()` without a config object. Set before calling `initializeSDK()`.
- **`Spreedly.isDeviceTrusted`**: Read-only property that returns `false` when the device fails integrity checks and the SDK is blocked. Replaces `isOperational`.
- **Auto-dismiss on blocked devices**: `CardFormDropIn`, `CVVRecachingView`, and `DoChallengeIfNeeded` automatically dismiss their sheets when presented on a blocked device. Custom forms using `SPLTextField` directly still require a manual `isDeviceTrusted` check.
- **LICENSE shipped inside artifacts**: The LICENSE file is now embedded in each `.xcframework` bundle and every `.zip` distribution archive.

### Changed

- **Renamed `Spreedly.isOperational` to `Spreedly.isDeviceTrusted`**: Aligns with industry conventions (Apple `canMakePayments`, Google `isReadyToPay`).
- **Forter3DS pinned to exact `2.1.0`**: Changed from up-to-next-major to exact version for deterministic builds.

### Fixed

- **`initializeSDK()` recovery**: Now correctly recovers from a previous security block when the device passes integrity checks.
- **Duplicate Objective-C class warnings resolved**: Eliminated runtime `Class X is implemented in both` warnings for Stripe, Datadog, and Braintree dependencies. SPM and CocoaPods consumers no longer see duplicate class loading.
- **Pending vs processing UI**: Payment example flows now render dedicated pending message styles for intermediate gateway states (Offsite, EBANX, Stripe APM, Braintree).

### Security

- Binary hardening, symbol stripping, and access-level tightening across all framework binaries to reduce reverse-engineering surface.

### Removed

- Removed unsupported Rapipago payment method from `OffsitePaymentMethodType`.
- Removed unsupported NuPay Recurrent payment method from `OffsitePaymentMethodType`.
- Removed unused `cryptoData` case from `PaymentMethodType`.

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-27

### Added

- Runtime integrity checks and jailbreak device detection.

## [1.2.7] - 2026-03-20

### Added

- **`sdk_platform` telemetry attribute**: New `sdkPlatform` field on `SpreedlyConfig` (default `.ios`). React Native bridges pass `.reactNative` to distinguish integration surface.
- **`source` field on payment method creation**: All payment method creation requests now include a `source` field identifying the checkout SDK platform (e.g. `"checkout-ios"`, `"checkout-react-native"`).

### Changed

- **`sdkPlatform` is now a `SdkPlatform` enum**: Replaced the `String?` parameter on `SpreedlyConfig` with a type-safe enum. **Breaking**: callers passing `sdkPlatform: "react_native"` must change to `sdkPlatform: .reactNative`.
- Documentation accuracy audit: corrected Forter 3DS install instructions, clarified Info.plist key requirements, updated dependency tables.
- Logging performance improvements with lazy evaluation.

### Fixed

- **Stripe APM pending vs processing**: iOS now correctly shows "processing" for Stripe APM payments (iDEAL, SEPA), matching the documented gateway behavior.
- `setConfig()` now correctly propagates `sdkPlatform` when reconfiguring an already-initialized SDK.
- **Card number paste handling**: Pasted input with dashes or dots is now normalized to digits only and displayed with proper space-separated groups.
- Thread safety and memory management improvements across multiple components.
- **Xcode Cloud TestFlight build**: Resolved stale `Package.resolved` that caused build failures in Xcode Cloud.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Telemetry events and attributes added for payment flows, 3DS, network, and error tracking.
- Version consistency, SBOM updates, documentation sync, and PCI compliance improvements.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- Fixed TestFlight validation by removing nested framework embed from SPLAccessibility.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed

- Fixed Xcode Cloud build by migrating to SPM and generating xcconfig on CI.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Updated version references and documentation for the 1.1.0 release.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- **Stripe APM Module** (`SpreedlyStripeAPM`): Stripe Alternative Payment Methods via native PaymentSheet. Supports iDEAL, Bancontact, EPS, P24, SEPA Debit. `SpreedlyStripeAPMCheckout` entry point with `StripeAPMConfig`. Backend-initiated flow with automatic status polling.
- **Braintree APM Module** (`SpreedlyBraintree`): Braintree PayPal and Venmo payments. `SpreedlyBraintreeCheckout` entry point with `BraintreeCheckoutConfig`. `BraintreePaymentType` enum for PayPal and Venmo selection. Full Objective-C support via `BraintreeURLHandlerObjC`.
- **EBANX Offsite Payments**: Pix, Boleto Bancario, NuPay, OXXO via EBANX with `DocumentId` support.
- **Gateway-Specific 3DS**: Gateway-managed 3D Secure authentication (e.g. Worldpay) with Safari-based challenge presentation and automatic status polling.
- **Offsite Payment Integration**: Safari-based offsite payment flow for PayPal and Sprel with `handleOffsiteReturn(url:)` for return handling.
- **CVV Recaching**: `SpreedlyCVVRecachingView` for updating CVV on saved payment methods with bottom sheet and dialog presentation modes.
- **Screen Prevention**: `ScreenPreventionSecureView` blocks screenshots and screen recording for PCI compliance.
- **Objective-C Support**: Full Objective-C compatibility via delegates, bridges, and `@objc` annotations including `SpreedlyPaymentDelegate`, `CardFormDropInViewController`, and `CVVRecachingViewController`.
- **Additional Fields**: Billing and shipping address fields via `AdditionalField` enum.
- **Card Brand Detection**: 50+ card brands with BIN pattern matching, Luhn validation, and brand-specific rules.
- **Theming**: Full theming system with light/dark mode support, Dynamic Type and Bold Text accessibility.
- **Localization**: Localized strings for Core, UI, Braintree, and Stripe APM modules.
- **DocC Documentation**: Documentation catalogs for SpreedlyCore, SpreedlyUI, SpreedlySecurity, and SpreedlyAnalytics.

### Security

- Log sanitization extended for card numbers, tokens, environment keys, and phone numbers.
- Sensitive card data automatically zeroed after API calls.
- Payment tokens masked in all example app views.

### Changed

- Datadog initialization now skips gracefully when no client token is configured.
- Fixed expiration date two-digit year pivot (years 50-99 now map to 1900s).
- Downgraded swift-tools-version from 6.1 to 6.0 for broader compatibility.

### Documentation
